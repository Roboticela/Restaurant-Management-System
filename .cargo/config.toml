# Cargo configuration for cross-compilation
# This file configures Cargo to properly cross-compile for various target architectures

# ARM64 / aarch64 Linux
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc"
# Uncomment and set if needed:
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib"]

# ARMv7 Linux (32-bit ARM with hardware floating point)
[target.armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
# Uncomment and set if needed:
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib"]

# Windows MinGW (cross-compilation from Linux)
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
linker = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
ar = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar"

# Additional environment variables for pkg-config cross-compilation
# These can be overridden via environment variables at build time

# Note: For cross-compilation to work properly with system libraries,
# you also need to set environment variables. See build-cross.sh script.
